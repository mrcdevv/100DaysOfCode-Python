# 100DaysOfCode

This is my 100DaysOfCode challenge from Replit.  
My replit profile: https://replit.com/@marcodeArg

# Things to Know

- All days, except for the challenges days, follow the next structure:

"Fix my code" section where the instructor give some broken code  
"Challenge" section where the instructor gives you a task to use everything taught on the day

- "Challenge days" were for testing the knowledge acquired in previous days
- Days 65 to 70 were about the tkinter library, which I wasn't interested in learning
- From day 77 onwards, I didn't include the "fix my code" section
- Day 85 I realized that hash function change every session. That's why I started using the hashlib library
